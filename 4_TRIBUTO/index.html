            <h3>Who is Satoru</h3>
            <p>
                Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He
                is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the
                pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four
                hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and
                train strong young allies.
            </p>
            <!-- Personalidade -->
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
                Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength, and he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant. He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming, during his fight with Toji Fushiguro who is father of Megumi Fushiguro your student, that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored one." This can be further exemplified when he was tasked with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for. However, any empathy of her death was soon negated by his extensive amount of pride and arrogance after perfecting his reverse cursed technique in his following battle against Toji Fushiguro.
            </p>
            <p>
                During intense battles, Satoru is seen to occasionally fall into a frenzied fighting state, urged by his determination for victory and undeniable proof that he alone is the strongest. His combative style is characterized by his aggressive and domineering attacks, while flaunting his mastered techniques to his opponents. Furthermore, in a crisis, he is capable of being cold-blooded. He will prioritize his enemies' destruction over saving innocent people when he believes that the sacrifice is unavoidable. However, this only extends to the people killed by his opponent; he will not do any lasting harm to or kill anyone innocent to gain the upper hand.

            <p>
                Nevertheless, despite his haughtiness and strength, Satoru is more human than he first appears. After defeating Toji, Satoru retrieved Riko's corpse with a sorrowful look, showing that albeit his recent conceited victory temporarily clouding his feelings, he still felt some grief over her death. He sought to kill the Star Religious Group members that were laughing over Riko's death, though was stopped by Suguru Geto — who he relied on as a moral compass at that time — before taking any action. Furthermore, Satoru was later left visibly horrified and panicked after learning that Suguru, his one and only best friend, had become a murderous curse user. Satoru attempted to reason with his friend, but eventually realized and accepted that he lost the one person he truly saw as an equal. After having to put an end to Suguru before more calamity arose, it was Satoru's trauma over losing his best friend that caused his ultimate downfall in Shibuya. He was also distraught when Yuji seemingly died.

            <h3>His Dream and his Famous sentence</h3>
            <p>
                Satoru's endgame is to reform the jujutsu world from the bottom-up through education. He seeks to foster a new generation of sorcerers that he hopes will one day become his equals.

                <h3>Abilities and Powers:</h3>
                <p>Satoru has a lot of abilities include his six eyes and his limitless but i only will concentrate in his Inherited Techniques</p>
                <fieldset>
                    <legend>Inherited Techniques</legend>
                <ul>
                    <li>Infinity (無む限げん Mugen?): Being the neutral form of the Limitless, the Infinity is commonly known as the ability to stop, although this is a common misconception as the true power of the Infinity is to slow things down. When something attempts to hit Satoru, the person or object in question instead hits the infinity between himself and them.</li>
                    <li>Cursed Technique Lapse - Maximum Cursed Energy Output: Blue (術じゅつ式しき順じゅん転てん出しゅつ力りょく最さい大だい「蒼あお」 Jutsushiki Junten Shutsuryoku Saidai・Ao?): Satoru creates a center of gravity in a specific space capable of attracting all matter, crushing it all effortlessly akin to a black hole. He can also move the point of gravity at will, augmenting its destructive capabilities greatly.</li>
                    <li>Cursed Technique Reversal: Red (術じゅつ式しき反はん転てん「赫あか」 Jutsushiki Hanten・Aka?): Being an inversion of Blue, Red has the opposite effect. Using his reversal technique to invert the properties of Blue, Satoru activates the divergence of his infinity and causes an extremely powerful repulsive force, repelling all matter in its vicinity. Being an ability that is powered by positive cursed energy and formed as a reverse curse technique, the ability has two times the destructive ability of Blue.</li>
                    <li>Hollow Technique: Purple (虚きょ式しき「茈むらさき」 Kyoshiki・Murasaki?): An advanced technique that collides the Lapse and Reversal of the Limitless, resulting in an imaginary mass that is launched at the target.</li>
                    <li>Domain Expansion:Unlimited Void (無む量りょう空くう処しょ Muryōkūsho?): Satoru's Domain Expansion. It creates a metaphysical space that causes the victims to receive all kinds of stimuli and information endlessly, restraining their thought processes and actions.</li>

                <p>The most wanted figth of all the manga happens Gojo Vs Sukuna,The fight between Gojo and Sukuna has certainly been enthralling. From the very beginning, it was clear that these two characters were almost evenly matched. The start of the battle just saw these two characters test out their abilities against one another to gauge the prowess of the other. It is safe to say that Gojo did more than just hold his own against the strongest of all time and also pushed him to the extreme. That certainly wasn't all, as Gojo also managed to overwhelm him in combat on more than one occasion. Their Domain Expansions were evenly matched for the most part, however, Gojo did see his Domain break on several occasions during the fight.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Sukuna also had quite a lot of trouble dealing with Gojo. The fact is that he had to rely on Domain Amplification to nullify Gojo's Infinity and make contact with him. However, at the same time, he could not use his Cursed Technique because doing both things simultaneously would be impossible. This meant that Sukuna had to rely on other methods while fighting and that is why he utilized Mahoraga to the fullest.</p>
                <p>As soon as Gojo launched this incredibly powerful nuke, it was quite clear that Sukuna would be on the ropes. He was injured to a point where he could not use Domain Amplification anymore and, at the same time, his healing ability was greatly compromised. With slow healing, an injured body, and no usage of Domain Amplification, it was quite clear that the victor here would be none other than Gojo Satoru.That is precisely where chapter 235 of Jujutsu Kaisen ended, however, chapter 236 delivered a massive shock to the fans that shook them to the very core. </p>

                <h4>Gojo's Death</h4>
                <p>The beginning of Jujutsu Kaisen 236 was rather strange to the fans. The chapter started with Gojo meeting his fellow friends who had already passed away. In a shocking turn of events, he started conversing with Geto and it was revealed to the fans that Gojo had actually lost the battle.</p>
                <p>Once fans returned to the present, it was revealed that Gojo had lost the battle and, subsequently, died. His entire body was chopped in half. Gojo's legs were standing but his torso was laying on the ground. His arm was also cut off and it is quite clear that from here onwards, the winner of the battle was Sukuna. When Gojo died, Sukuna mocked him one last time and told him that he would never forget him before laughing in his face. Clearly, this death has shaken the watchers as well as the fans of the series. Killing off Gojo is a very brave step on the part of the author and also quite possibly a very questionable one.</p>

                <h3>Legacy of Satoru Gojo</h3>
                <p>Gojo's legacy is unarguably the students he nurtured and made into strong, capable sorcerers. He took pride in his role as an educator, so there's probably nothing else that would make him happier than seeing his beloved students thrive. Gojo was the strongest living being, and that's what made him lonely. He was unhappy being on the top, which made him rely on Geto too much. This is why Geto's betrayal affected him until his death. After Geto left, Gojo's life centered around his students. He planned to reform the Jujutsu Society not by bloodshed but by nurturing the future generation of sorcerers.</p>
